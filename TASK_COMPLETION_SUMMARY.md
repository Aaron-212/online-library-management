## ⚠️ Potential Backend Issues

### Missing Controllers
The backend appears to be missing controllers for:
- **ReservationController**: No controller found for `/api/v1/reservations` endpoints
- **FavoriteController**: No controller found for `/api/v1/favorites` endpoints

### Backend Implementation Needed
While the frontend is fully implemented, the backend may need:

1. **ReservationController** with endpoints:
   - `GET /api/v1/reservations/user` - Get user reservations
   - `POST /api/v1/reservations` - Create reservation
   - `DELETE /api/v1/reservations/{id}` - Cancel reservation

2. **FavoriteController** with endpoints:
   - `GET /api/v1/favorites/user` - Get user favorites
   - `POST /api/v1/favorites` - Add favorite
   - `DELETE /api/v1/favorites/{id}` - Remove favorite
   - `GET /api/v1/favorites/check/{bookId}` - Check if book is favorited

3. **Repository Classes**:
   - `ReservationRepository`
   - `FavoriteRepository` (if Favorite entity exists)

## 🎯 Summary

✅ **All frontend issues have been resolved:**
- Branch conflicts: Resolved
- Chinese text: Fully translated to English
- API integration: Complete with proper services, error handling, and user experience

⚠️ **Backend may need attention:**
- Missing reservation and favorite endpoints
- Views will show "Failed to load" errors until backend endpoints are implemented

## 🚀 Next Steps (If Needed)

1. Implement missing backend controllers and repositories
2. Test all API endpoints with the frontend
3. Ensure proper authentication and authorization on backend endpoints
4. Test the complete user flow for reservations and favorites
